# Dynamic-Programming-Scheduler

### This project all about dynamic programming and greedy algorithm.

Program needs a input.json file and gson.jar(for reading the json file correctly.).
Example input file is given as "input.json".

##### *If there are some assignment to do and you cant schedule it, you can use this program.*

-There is a weight for each assignment and it is calculating like:
weight = (importance Ã— (maellard ? 1001 : 1)) /duration 

-Program will read the json file, create the assignment objects and schedule them by dynamic programming and
greedy algorithm each.

-There will be 2 output files named "solution_dynamic.json" and "solution_greedy.json"
